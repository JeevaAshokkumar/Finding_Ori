The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. Propagation of the genetic material between generations requires timely and accurate duplication of DNA by semiconservative replication prior to cell division to ensure each daughter cell receives the full complement of chromosomes.
The availability of hundreds of complete bacterial genomes has created new challenges and simultaneously opportunities for bioinformatics. In the area of statistical analysis of genomic sequences, the studies of nucleotide compositional bias and gene bias between strands and replichores paved way to the development of tools for prediction of bacterial replication origins.
Here, We've used Several Biological Concepts like Replication Ring Formation, Deamination, and Forward & Reverse Half-Strand Synthesis.
Algorithms like Symbol Array, Skew Array, Hamming Distance are used to Find the Region where the life begins to Replicate.
